Contributing
-------------------------

1. Create local repository by cloning the project from GitHub. The ``main`` branch is the stable branch. **Do not use it to write or test your contributions**.
2. Open the ``dev`` branch (or a local branch) to write and test your contributions locally.
3. Write or update a notebook in the respective ``part`` folder (e.g., ``intro``).
4. Add the notebook to the ``_toc.yml`` file in the respective section.
5. Submit a pull request to the ``dev`` branch and ask for a review.
6. Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the ``dev`` branch (and eventually into the ``main`` branch).
